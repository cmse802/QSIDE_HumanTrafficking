1. Read in the excel spreadsheet/data table in which the user is recording the sources of the data using `Pandas`.
2. Select the column which indicates what source the data is in.
3. Turn the column values into a list and ensure values that contain more than one source are split up
4. Count the values of the list and track the labels (ensure the labels are not duplicated)
5. Utilize `matplotlib` and `seaborn` to convert the labels and occurrences into a pie chart.
